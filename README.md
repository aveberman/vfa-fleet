**Video S1:** Demonstration of two-shot, unaccelerated, conventional-segmented EPI, VFA-FLEET-Sinc, and VFA-FLEET-SLR in a single subject (subject 1) at 3 T. Every other repetition out of 60 is displayed without inter-segment normalization. This subject exhibited motion that resulted in severe intermittent ghosting artifacts in the conventional-segmented acquisition, whereas the VFA-FLEET acquisitions were relatively stable. Stable ghosting in VFA-FLEET-Sinc is present in all repetitions. Note that, due to the motion levels, all scans from this subject were excluded from further analyses.

![Video S2](img/vidS2_2shot_3T_axial1x2_subj3.avi.gif)
**Video S2:** Demonstration of two-shot, unaccelerated, conventional-segmented EPI, VFA-FLEET-Sinc, and VFA-FLEET-SLR in a single subject (subject 3, same subject as shown in Fig. 3) at 3 T. Every other repetition out of 60 is displayed without inter-segment normalization. This subject exhibited little motion, resulting in stable imaging in all acquisitions. Stable ghosting in VFA-FLEET-Sinc is present in all repetitions.

![Video S3](img/vidS3_3shot_3T_axial1x2_subj1.avi.gif)
**Video S3:** Demonstration of three-shot, unaccelerated, conventional-segmented EPI, VFA-FLEET-Sinc, and VFA-FLEET-SLR in a single subject (subject 1) at 3 T. Every other repetition out of 60 is displayed without inter-segment normalization. This subject exhibited motion that resulted in severe intermittent ghosting artifacts in the conventional-segmented acquisition, whereas the VFA-FLEET acquisitions were relatively stable. Stable ghosting in VFA-FLEET-Sinc is present in all repetitions. Note that due to the motion levels, all scans from this subject were excluded from further analyses.

**Video S4:** Demonstration of three-shot, unaccelerated, conventional-segmented EPI, VFA-FLEET-Sinc, and VFA-FLEET-SLR in a single subject (subject 3, same subject as shown in Fig. 3) at 3 T. Every other repetition out of 60 is displayed without inter-segment normalization. This subject exhibited little motion, resulting in stable imaging in all acquisitions. Stable ghosting in VFA-FLEET-Sinc is present in all repetitions.

![Video S5](img/vidS5_2shot_7T_axial1x2_subj6.avi.gif)
**Video S5:** Demonstration of two-shot, R = 4, 1-mm isotropic conventional-segmented EPI, VFA-FLEET-Sinc, and VFA-FLEET-SLR in a single subject (subject 6) at 7 T. Every other repetition out of 60 is displayed without inter-segment normalization. This subject had negligible motion, however, the conventional-segmented acquisition still exhibited intermittent ghosting, presumably due to B0-induced fluctuations from respiration, whereas the VFA-FLEET acquisitions were relatively stable. Stable ghosting, manifesting as unresolved aliasing and bands or broad regions of signal dropout, is present to a greater extent in VFA-FLEET-Sinc than in VFA-FLEET-SLR.

![Video S6](img/vidS6_2shot_7T_axial1x2_subj9.avi.gif)
**Video S6:** Demonstration of two-shot, R = 4, 1-mm isotropic conventional-segmented EPI, VFA-FLEET-Sinc, and VFA-FLEET-SLR in a single subject (subject 9, same subject as shown in Fig. 4) at 7 T. Every other repetition out of 60 is displayed without inter-segment normalization. The conventional-segmented acquisition exhibited intermittent ghosting during periods of negligible motion, presumably due to B0-induced fluctuations from respiration, and increased ghosting during head motion. The VFA-FLEET acquisitions were relatively stable. Stable ghosting, manifesting as unresolved aliasing and bands or broad regions of signal dropout, is present to a greater extent in VFA-FLEET-Sinc than in VFA-FLEET-SLR.

**Video S7:** Demonstration of three-shot, R = 4, 1-mm isotropic conventional-segmented EPI, VFA-FLEET-Sinc, and VFA-FLEET-SLR in a single subject (subject 6) at 7 T. Every other repetition out of 60 is displayed without inter-segment normalization. This subject had negligible motion, however, the conventional-segmented acquisition still exhibited intermittent ghosting, presumably due to B0-induced fluctuations from respiration, whereas the VFA-FLEET acquisitions were relatively stable. Stable ghosting, manifesting as unresolved aliasing and bands or broad regions of signal dropout, is present to a greater extent in VFA-FLEET-Sinc than in VFA-FLEET-SLR.

**Video S8:** Demonstration of three-shot, R = 4, 1-mm isotropic conventional-segmented EPI, VFA-FLEET-Sinc, and VFA-FLEET-SLR in a single subject (subject 9, same subject as shown in Fig. 4) at 7 T. Every other repetition out of 60 is displayed without inter-segment normalization. The conventional-segmented acquisition exhibited intermittent ghosting during periods of negligible motion, presumably due to B0-induced fluctuations from respiration, and intensified ghosting during head motion. The VFA-FLEET acquisitions were relatively stable. Stable ghosting, manifesting as unresolved aliasing and bands or broad regions of signal dropout, is present to a greater extent in VFA-FLEET-Sinc than in VFA-FLEET-SLR.
